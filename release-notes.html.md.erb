##<a id="ver-1-2-2"></a> v1.2.2

**Release Date: August 7, 2018**

### <a id="features121"></a> Features

New features and changes in this release:

* **[Bug Fix]** Adds support for external Azure MySQL databases and other cases where usernames contain the '@' symbol. 
* SMTP verification is no longer required. To skip SMTP verification, simply bypass that step in the set up process. 
* Maintenance update of the following product dependencies
    * Flyway Command-line now v.5.1.4
    * Golang now v1.10.3
    * Product stemcell now Ubuntu Xenial v97.3

### <a id="known121"></a> Known Issues

* **[Known Issue]** When saving the MySQL settings page with Azure style usernames: 'userId@serverName'. This error can be ignored when deploying. If the MySQL verification error appears with non-Azure style usernames, it is most likely an issue with the configuration of the MySQL database connection details.

##<a id="ver-1-2-1"></a> v1.2.1

**Release Date: July 17, 2018**

### <a id="features121"></a> Features

New features and changes in this release:

* To view Healthwatch topics, you must have [PCF Healthwatch v.1.3] (https://docs.pivotal.io/pcf-healthwatch) installed.
* Dependence on notifications has been removed.
* Email configuration is now an option. 
  <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Specifying email configuration settings is required if you want notifications sent by email.</p>
    For more information, see [Configure Email Notifications](installing.html#email_settings).   
* All destination email addresses now receive validation messages.
  Before v1.2.1, if the notification email address was the same as the account creating the target, the email address was verified automatically.

### <a id="known121"></a> Known Issues

* **[Bug Identified]** When using an external Azure MySQL database or other databases where usernames contain the '@' symbol, authenticating will not work. This is fixed in PCF Event Alerts 1.2.2.
