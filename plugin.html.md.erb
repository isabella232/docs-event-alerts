###<a id='example-workflow-webhook'></a> Example Workflow: Sending all Healthwatch alerts to a webhook

1. Create a webhook target named webhook-ops:

```
cf eva-create-target webhook-ops webhook http://example.com/healthwatch
```

2. Verify that the target is created correctly with `cf eva-targets`.

3. Subscribe the newly created target to all healthwatch topics:

```
cf eva-subscribe webhook-ops healthwatch --all
```

4. Publish a sample message to a healthwatch topic. This requires one of ("notifications.write", "cloud_controller.admin", "network.admin") scopes.

```
cf eva-sample-publish healthwatch system.healthy
```

5. Verify a webhook message was posted to the webhook-ops URL (eg http://example.com/healthwatch)
