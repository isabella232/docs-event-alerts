* **Event Alerts Fails to Release IP Binding on MySQL Upgrade:** When upgrading from Pivotal MySQL 2.4.x to 2.5.x the MySQL service switches from IP bindings to hostname bindings.
Event Alerts sometimes fails to release the IP binding when following the [documentation](https://docs.pivotal.io/p-mysql/2-5/troubleshoot.html#deprecated-service-bindings)
for this process. Please refer to the [Troubleshooting section](./troubleshooting.html#ip-binding) for details.
