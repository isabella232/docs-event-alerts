<p class="note breaking"><strong>Breaking Change: </strong>PCF Event Alerts v1.2.3 and later require a Xenial stemcell.
You must manually download and import a new stemcell into the Ops Manager Stemcell Library before deploying PCF Event Alerts.
Any automation you have set up to update your PCF Event Alerts deployments using Trusty stemcells may break.</p>

### <a id="known121"></a> Known Issues

* **[Bug Identified]** Users of Event Alerts v1.2.1 are required to use escape characters in configuration passwords. This is no longer required in Event Alerts v1.2.3 and later releases. 
* **[Known Issue]** When saving the MySQL settings page with Azure style usernames (for example: 'userId@serverName), you may see an error message due to non-support of the `@` character. This is resolved in Event Alerts 1.2.3
