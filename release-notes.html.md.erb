### <a id="known130"></a> Known Issues

This release has the following issues:

#### MySQL Migrations With External Database Fail Due to log_bin_trust_function_creators

If the Deploy PCF Event Alerts errand fails with the error `You do not have the SUPER privilege and binary logging is enabled (you *might* want to use the less safe log_bin_trust_function_creators variable)`,
the next time Deploy PCF Event Alerts errand runs, it will fail due to the migration trying to recreate existing tables.

The only way to resolve this is issue is to:
  1. Drop the Event Alerts database and recreate it
  2. In addition, either:
     * Disable Binary Logging in the database
     * Or set the `log_bin_trust_function_creators` variable in the database to `true`
  3. Re-run the Deploy PCF Event Alerts errand
