## <a id='overview'></a>Overview

As an admin, you may want to receive notifications about important events that occur on your system.
The <%= vars.product_name %> service gives you the option to set up alerts for a variety of events.
You can use this service to subscribe to notification topics---notable events that might occur.
Notification topics are monitored by publishers---<%= vars.platform_name %> components that emit events.
You can send these notifications using email, Slack, or webhook integration.

For example, you can subscribe to a topic from [Pivotal Healthwatch](http://docs.pivotal.io/pcf-healthwatch/1-2/index.html)
that sends a notification when the memory use on a specific VM reaches a certain percentage.

<%= vars.platform_name %> users with admin permissions can run event alert commands and subscribe to alerts.
Admins can configure event alerts using the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (cf CLI) tool.
